# XOR Encryption
## Contents
- xorjs.js contains the JavaScript functions used in index.html
- xor.php contains the PHP functions used in index.html
  - NOTE: The PHP functions are out of date as I decided to use JavaScript halfway through the project.
- theme.css contains all the CSS for index.html
